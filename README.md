# CloneDroneModdedMultiplayer
CloneDroneModdedMultiplayer is an attempt at a mod for clone drone in the danger zone that re-adds multiplayer. Why is this necessary? Doesnt clone drone already have multiplayer support? Well yes, but the official multiplayer doesn't support mods, and whats the fun in that?

This mod uses [Mod-Bot](https://github.com/X606/modbot) to interact and get loaded by Clone drone.

## Setup
1. In order to compile this project you need to first install Mod-Bot on the latest version of clone drone (this mod uses the Mod-Bot 1.4.4 beta version of Mod-Bot and the experimental branch of clone drone). 
2. Copy all of the files in the `Clone Drone in the Danger Zone\Clone Drone in the Danger Zone_Data\Managed` folder into `UsedDlls`
3. Now just open the .sln file and you should be set.
